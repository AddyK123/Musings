# Musings
Hi and welcome to Musings, my independent column for Columbia Univerity's Art and Humanities Magazine.
Although the magazine is in print form, I've added some of my top rated long-form critiques to this repo.
You can read pieces on Western Art History or the Role of Opera in Modern society below.
  As always, feel free to let me know what you think!
